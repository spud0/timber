A logging utility for C++ programs. 

## Why? ##
I wanted to learn how to implement a logger. There are a few ways to go about handling how the logger actually writes to disk, 
which makes this interesting.

- This depends on a toml parsing library [toml.hpp](https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus/)
- This will also use ``c++ std::source_location`` which gives me useful metadata about function's and line numbers of various statements.
